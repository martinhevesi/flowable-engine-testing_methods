/**
 * Maintains an ordered composite list of child ELResolvers. Though only a single ELResolver is
 * associated with an ELContext, there are usually multiple resolvers considered for any given
 * variable or property resolution. ELResolvers are combined together using a CompositeELResolver,
 * to define rich semantics for evaluating an expression. For the
 * {@link #getValue(ELContext, Object, Object)}, {@link #getType(ELContext, Object, Object)},
 * {@link #setValue(ELContext, Object, Object, Object)} and
 * {@link #isReadOnly(ELContext, Object, Object)} methods, an ELResolver is not responsible for
 * resolving all possible (base, property) pairs. In fact, most resolvers will only handle a base of
 * a single type. To indicate that a resolver has successfully resolved a particular (base,
 * property) pair, it must set the propertyResolved property of the ELContext to true. If it could
 * not handle the given pair, it must leave this property alone. The caller must ignore the return
 * value of the method if propertyResolved is false. The CompositeELResolver initializes the
 * ELContext.propertyResolved flag to false, and uses it as a stop condition for iterating through
 * its component resolvers. The ELContext.propertyResolved flag is not used for the design-time
 * methods {@link #getFeatureDescriptors(ELContext, Object)} and
 * {@link #getCommonPropertyType(ELContext, Object)}. Instead, results are collected and combined
 * from all child ELResolvers for these methods.
