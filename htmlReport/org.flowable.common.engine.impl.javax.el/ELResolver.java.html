/**
 * Enables customization of variable and property resolution behavior for EL expression evaluation.
 * 
 * While evaluating an expression, the ELResolver associated with the ELContext is consulted to do
 * the initial resolution of the first variable of an expression. It is also consulted when a . or
 * [] operator is encountered, except for the last such operator in a method expression, in which
 * case the resolution rules are hard coded.
 * 
 * For example, in the EL expression ${employee.lastName}, the ELResolver determines what object
 * employee refers to, and what it means to get the lastName property on that object.
 * 
 * Most methods in this class accept a base and property parameter. In the case of variable
 * resolution (e.g. determining what employee refers to in ${employee.lastName}), the base parameter
 * will be null and the property parameter will always be of type String. In this case, if the
 * property is not a String, the behavior of the ELResolver is undefined.
 * 
 * In the case of property resolution, the base parameter identifies the base object and the
 * property object identifies the property on that base. For example, in the expression
 * ${employee.lastName}, base is the result of the variable resolution for employee and property is
 * the string &quot;lastName&quot;. In the expression ${y[x]}, base is the result of the variable resolution
 * for y and property is the result of the variable resolution for x.
 * 
 * Though only a single ELResolver is associated with an ELContext, there are usually multiple
 * resolvers considered for any given variable or property resolution. ELResolvers are combined
 * together using {@link CompositeELResolver}s, to define rich semantics for evaluating an
 * expression. For the {@link #getValue(ELContext, Object, Object)},
 * {@link #getType(ELContext, Object, Object)}, {@link #setValue(ELContext, Object, Object, Object)}
 * and {@link #isReadOnly(ELContext, Object, Object)} methods, an ELResolver is not responsible for
 * resolving all possible (base, property) pairs. In fact, most resolvers will only handle a base of
 * a single type. To indicate that a resolver has successfully resolved a particular (base,
 * property) pair, it must set the propertyResolved property of the ELContext to true. If it could
 * not handle the given pair, it must leave this property alone. The caller must ignore the return
 * value of the method if propertyResolved is false.
 * 
 * The {@link #getFeatureDescriptors(ELContext, Object)} and
 * {@link #getCommonPropertyType(ELContext, Object)} methods are primarily designed for design-time
 * tool support, but must handle invocation at runtime as well. The java.beans.Beans.isDesignTime()
 * method can be used to determine if the resolver is being consulted at design-time or runtime.

	/**
	 * Returns information about the set of variables or properties that can be resolved for the
	 * given base object. One use for this method is to assist tools in auto-completion. If the base
	 * parameter is null, the resolver must enumerate the list of top-level variables it can
	 * resolve. The Iterator returned must contain zero or more instances of
	 * java.beans.FeatureDescriptor, in no guaranteed order. In the case of primitive types such as
	 * int, the value null must be returned. This is to prevent the useless iteration through all
	 * possible primitive values. A return value of null indicates that this resolver does not
	 * handle the given base object or that the results are too complex to represent with this
	 * method and the {@link #getCommonPropertyType(ELContext, Object)} method should be used
	 * instead. Each FeatureDescriptor will contain information about a single variable or property.
	 * In addition to the standard properties, the FeatureDescriptor must have two named attributes
	 * (as set by the setValue method):
	 * &lt;ul&gt;
	 * &lt;li&gt;{@link #TYPE} - The value of this named attribute must be an instance of java.lang.Class
	 * and specify the runtime type of the variable or property.&lt;/li&gt;
	 * &lt;li&gt;{@link #RESOLVABLE_AT_DESIGN_TIME} - The value of this named attribute must be an
	 * instance of java.lang.Boolean and indicates whether it is safe to attempt to resolve this
	 * property at designtime. For instance, it may be unsafe to attempt a resolution at design time
	 * if the ELResolver needs access to a resource that is only available at runtime and no
	 * acceptable simulated value can be provided.&lt;/li&gt;
	 * &lt;/ul&gt;
	 * The caller should be aware that the Iterator returned might iterate through a very large or
	 * even infinitely large set of properties. Care should be taken by the caller to not get stuck
	 * in an infinite loop. This is a &quot;best-effort&quot; list. Not all ELResolvers will return completely
	 * accurate results, but all must be callable at both design-time and runtime (i.e. whether or
	 * not Beans.isDesignTime() returns true), without causing errors. The propertyResolved property
