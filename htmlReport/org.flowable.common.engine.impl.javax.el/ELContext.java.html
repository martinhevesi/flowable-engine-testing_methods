/**
 * Context information for expression evaluation. To evaluate an {@link Expression}, an ELContext
 * must be provided. The ELContext holds:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;a reference to the base {@link ELResolver} that will be consulted to resolve model objects
 * and their properties&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;a reference to {@link FunctionMapper} that will be used to resolve EL Functions.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;a reference to {@link VariableMapper} that will be used to resolve EL Variables.&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;a collection of all the relevant context objects for use by ELResolvers&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;state information during the evaluation of an expression, such as whether a property has been
 * resolved yet&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * The collection of context objects is necessary because each ELResolver may need access to a
 * different context object. For example, JSP and Faces resolvers need access to a
 * jakarta.servlet.jsp.JspContext and a javax.faces.context.FacesContext, respectively. Creation of
 * ELContext objects is controlled through the underlying technology. For example, in JSP the
 * JspContext.getELContext() factory method is used. Some technologies provide the ability to add an
 * {@link ELContextListener} so that applications and frameworks can ensure their own context
 * objects are attached to any newly created ELContext. Because it stores state during expression
 * evaluation, an ELContext object is not thread-safe. Care should be taken to never share an
 * ELContext instance between two or more threads.
