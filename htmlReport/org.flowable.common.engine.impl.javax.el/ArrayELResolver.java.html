/**
 * Defines property resolution behavior on arrays. This resolver handles base objects that are Java
 * language arrays. It accepts any object as a property and coerces that object into an integer
 * index into the array. The resulting value is the value in the array at that index. This resolver
 * can be constructed in read-only mode, which means that isReadOnly will always return true and
 * {@link #setValue(ELContext, Object, Object, Object)} will always throw
 * PropertyNotWritableException. ELResolvers are combined together using {@link CompositeELResolver}
 * s, to define rich semantics for evaluating an expression. See the javadocs for {@link ELResolver}
 * for details.
